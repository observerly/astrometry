/**
 *
 * SGP4Error
 *
 * The error of a propagation by the SGP4 theory, e.g., an element set whose orbit the theory can no
 * longer resolve at the time it is propagated to, such as one that has decayed, or one that the
 * theory cannot propagate at all.
 *
 * Each failure the theory reports is raised as an error of its own, e.g., a subclass of this one,
 * so that a caller may handle a failure by its class, e.g., with instanceof, or handle every
 * failure of the theory alike by this class.
 *
 * The code of the error is that of the reference implementation, e.g., the error code that the
 * sgp4init() and sgp4() routines of Vallado et al. report, where the failure is one that it reports:
 *
 * - 1: the mean eccentricity is not within [0, 1).
 * - 2: the mean motion is not greater than zero.
 * - 3: the perturbed eccentricity is not within [0, 1].
 * - 4: the semi-latus rectum is less than zero.
 * - 6: the orbit has decayed, e.g., its radius is less than that of the Earth.
 *
 * N.B. The code 5 of the reference implementation is no longer in use, and a failure that the
 * reference implementation does not report, e.g., an element set of an ephemeris type the theory
 * does not propagate, carries no code.
 *
 * @see Vallado, D. A., Crawford, P., Hujsak, R., & Kelso, T. S. (2006), "Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3", AIAA 2006-6753.
